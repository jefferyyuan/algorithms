/**
   This program implements code that allows the user to play a game of
    boggle, the famous fun fabulous board game.  However to display
    the results of the BogglePlayer class and game, Boggle GUI must be
    implemented as a graphical interface and to interpret the results
    of BoglePlayer.  The results are stored in useful data structures,
    such to make for easy retrieval and implementation.  The game
    works for any sized board and for any minimum word length.  The
    computer then gets all valid words from the board and displays
    them, thus thoroughly trouncing the human opponent.  The program
    checks the input the user puts in, and checks the board and all
    the words in enable1.txt (the dictionary) and gives the user
    points for that word.  In this fashion a Boggle Game is played.

 *
 * BogglePlayer implements methods that will be used by {@link
 * BoggleGUI} to play an interactive game of Boggle.  The code will
 * work for boards of any size, and for any minimum sized word length.
